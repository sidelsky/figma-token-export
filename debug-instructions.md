## Troubleshooting by Symptom

### Nothing happens when clicking Export
**Likely cause**: JavaScript not loading
**Check**: Console for error messages, ensure ui.js exists

### Button changes but no success message
**Likely cause**: No variables in file or plugin communication issue
**Check**: Create test variables, check console for "Found 0 collections"

### Plugin window doesn't open
**Likely cause**: Manifest or file path issue
**Check**: Verify manifest.json, code.js, ui.html exist

### "Export button not found!" in console
**Likely cause**: HTML structure issue
**Check**: Verify ui.html has element with id="exportBtn"
